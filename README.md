# Financial Timeseries Patterns library
This package contains a growing collection of price pattern detectors (online and offline).  I am slowly open sourcing
a number of indicators and models I have found useful (and continue to use) over the years.  

## Functionality
Here is a (growing) list of functionality provided by the library
- AmplitudeBasedLabeller ([doc](/docs/AmplitudeBasedLabeler.md))
